# Two-Phase-Dispatch-Heuristic
Implemented a Two Phase Dispatch Heuristic that adopts the concepts of Pareto optimality and spanning-tree construction to allow arbitrary number of mobile sensors and event locations to try to reduce and balance the energy consumption of mobile sensors in each round of simulations.

Run using Network Simulator 2
